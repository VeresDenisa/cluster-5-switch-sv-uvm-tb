test_no_2:
First control packet -> disable switch_en_in for 1 clock at the same time as DA doesn't cause a dropped packet.

test_no_8:
Reset affects the memory!!!!!!!
If the DA doesn't match any memory port addresses, then the data is driven out on all the ports.

test_no_12:
If you put port_read on 0 for one clock the output data is still dven out. Shouldn't it stop for one clock and wait for it to be 0 again?





1. How should you treat the case when 2 or more memory port addresses are identical?
